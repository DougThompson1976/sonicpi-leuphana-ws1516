############################################################
# First Steps
############################################################

# What you can do if you don't know where to start
############################################################

# 1. Work with the following expressions and create something:

comment do

  play 60
  sleep 1

  in_thread
  # some code here ...
end

comment do
#use_synth :sine
#use_synth_defaults, amp: 1 # more parameters

end

# 2. Work with the inbuild examples and the documentation of Sonic Pi
#
# Please follow this rule: Do not copy and paste. Type everything.

# 3. Play with the inbuild Sample Collection

# use:

comment do

  sample [sample_name]

  # and the different parameter such as
  # rate, start, finish, beat_stretch, pitch_stretch.
  # Refer to the documentation to see how these work.

  # Combine samples, play them together or in succession and
  # experiment with the timing.
  
end

# 4. Start trying to realise an idea of you own.
#
# Break the idea up into simple and small steps
# Try to make these happen.
# Leave aside for now any steps which seem to difficult at the moment.
# Ask and/or try to find a solution in the examples or the documentation.

# Finding Help
############################################################

# If you find an expression you don't know, look it up in the manual.
# Open the help files with Alt-i (or click on 'Help')
# For easy access position the cursor on the expressen and type Ctrl-i.

# Comment/uncomment
############################################################

# You can 'comment' code which you don't need right now but you do not
# want to delete with

comment do
  # code will not run
end

# You can 'uncomment' with 'uncomment' (meaning: if you press 'run' code
# will 'run' or in other words 'will be evaluated by Sonic Pi'). 

comment do
  # code will run
end

# Play and Sleep
############################################################

# You play a note and sleep a duration.
# You can call a note by different names
# e.g.
# midi numbers
# See: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/NoteNamesFrequenciesAndMidiNumbers_v2.svg
# international names such as c4 => :c4
# or tonal degrees such as C major,
# meaning e.g. the 1st, 2nd, 3rd a.s.o note of C major =>
# degree(:i, :c4, :major) or
# degree(1, :c4, :major)

# and set a duration in different ways:
# 1 (1 second or beat), 1.0/4

comment do
  play :g4
  sleep 0.25
  play 67                     # = g4
  sleep 0.25
  play degree(5, :c4, :major) # = g4
  sleep 0.25
  play :c5
  sleep 0.25
  play :c5
  sleep 0.25
  play :c5
  sleep 0.25
  play :a4
  sleep 0.25 * 2              # = 0.5
  play :f4
  sleep 1.0 / 2               # = 0.5
  play :c4
  sleep 4.0 / 8               # = 0.5
end

# There are some reasons to calculate the duration rather than
# hard wiring it. A rather obvious one:

comment do

  4.times do
    sample :loop_amen, rate: 2
    sleep sample_duration(:loop_amen, rate: 2)
    # sleep 1
  end
end

# Augmented and diminished notes:
# :cs4 = C s(harp), 4th octave or "ein gestrichenes Cis"
# :db4 = C b (flat), 4th octave or "ein gestrichenes Des"
