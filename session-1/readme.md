# Introduction to Sonic Pi

All four files in this directory are meant as a basis for a presentation for the first course session. On the one hand I wanted to show gradually, what and how you can do things with Sonic Pi. On the other I tried to create a little piece of music, which whets the course participant's appetite to code on their own.

## How to run the code

The four files are self contained of each other. They do make heavy use of the `comment do/end` expression. So if you run them, don't forget do to a `uncomment` at the sections you'd like to try out.

To run the code:

* Click on the file name
* Click the button `raw`
* Copy the code from the browser window and
* Paste it into Sonic Pi
* Uncomment the wanted sections, listen, change, explore

## Ressourcen

There is a demonstration online, based on the file `session-01-IV.rb`. Using some variables I start/stop the different `live_loops` of the script to create a piece of music.
